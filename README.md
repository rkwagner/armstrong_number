whether or not that integer is an Armstrong Number.
An Armstrong Number is defined as one which the sum of the cubes
of all digits in the number is the same as the original number.

## Example

gcc -o armstrong armstrong_number.c

./armstrong.exe
Enter a number to see if it is an Armstrong Number: 153
153 is an Armstrong number.

./armstrong.exe
Enter a number to see if it is an Armstrong Number: 158
158 is NOT an Armstrong number.  Sum is 638
